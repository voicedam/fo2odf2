<h1>Conversion of formatting objects to ODF (abstract)</h1>
<p>
This thesis deals with conversion of text documents from the format of so called formatting objects (XSL FO) to OpenDocument format (ODF). This conversion can be useful e. g. for distribution, printing or additional modification of a document in a text editor which supports ODF (e. g. OpenOffice).
</p>
<p>
The thesis starts with description of both formats and it mentions basic elements that the formats offer for defining a text document. A comparison of both formats and description of possibilities of converting documents from XSL FO to ODF follows right after. The proved-by-practise and widely available XSLT transformation is chosen for the conversion implementation. It is illustrated on a sample application which enables to launch the conversion from an internet browser, from OpenOffice or from a command line.
